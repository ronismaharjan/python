# We cannot add string with integer 
# for eg:

# age = 12
# print("hello my age is " + age + "years")

# we will get type error

# we can use type() function to check the type of the variable 

a = 23
print(type(a))


# Type conversion
# for converting we can use following function

# To string
str(variable_name)
float(variable_name)
int(variable_name)
